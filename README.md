# Temperature-App
Temperature App built in React, JavaScript, HTML. Mostly created just to see if I could create it

This app uses React and an API to send and receive requests.

Enabling Chrome to use your current location will show your current temperature and weather for your location.

You can search for a city and it will display the weather and temperature there. Options also include the ability to swap between Celsius and Fahrenheit (requires the user to search again though)
